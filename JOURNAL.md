## 10/19/2025 - My first entry...  

Hey guys!! I am looking into some resources for modelling hollow objects in blender. For the electronics, i have purchased a set of strip LED lights of the white color. Currently trying to power them using USB cables, for easy applications.

Cheers!!!!![image.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MzM0NywicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--b6e1fc30baad1423a977e83eddec58e6f8edf703/image.png)

Designed the base to hold the lotus and the LED lights in it using Fusion. A small side hole for easy out for the usb cable to be soldered on the led strip.
